Thank you for contributing!

**Please open an issue** before embarking on any significant pull request, especially those that add a new library or change existing tests, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not end up being merged into the project.

Before opening a pull request, please ensure:

- [ ] Double-check your branch is based on `develop` and targets `develop` 
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] The PR title is clear, concise and follows [`conventional commit`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) formatting.
- [ ] README documentation is updated for new features (VERY IMPORTANT, undocumented features cannot be discovered and used!)
- [ ] Description explains the issue/use-case resolved and auto-closes related issues.

Be kind to code reviewers, please try to keep pull requests as small and focused as possible :)

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the MIT License.
